  <h2>Music is a big part of everything, it's in movies, games, and all sorts of media. Some music is fast-paced and fun, while others are slow and reflective. Music can help with storytelling and make you feel something.</h2>

<b>There are a lot of genres in music.</b>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to:
   Rock & Roll, Rap, Pop, Funk, Country, R&B, and Jazz.</p>
  
<b>There are some music generes there are a mixture of two different kinds of music.</b>
<small>A good example of this is one of my favorite types of music, Jazzhop. Jazzhop is a mixture of Jazz and Lofi, which is known for its relaxing beats.</small>

  
  
<b>Now that I've talked about music, let me talk about what it means to me.</b>
<h2>Music has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. I was in a church choir when I was a kid and enjoyed it. Throughout middle school, I always was in the school musicals which caught the attention of the high school choir teacher. I was in choir in high school and realized how much I loved music and plan to get a minor in music production in the future</h2>
  
  
<h3>Music is a beautiful piece of art. It means a lot to me and many others. It is an extention to the musican and just wonderful to listen to.</h3>
